# QR Flashcards

This is a basic flashcards app, built to be small enough that all of its code fits within a single QR code.

## Features of the code

Here's some of the fun features of this code, done in the name of minification (or perhaps just because I felt like it):

- 🎉 Global variables!
- 🎉 Impure functions!
  - Side effects my beloved 😍
- 🎉 A variable called `$`!
  - It's like jQuery, but without the jQuery!
